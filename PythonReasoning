def llm_logical_reasoning_algorithm(situation):
  """
  This function implements the LLM Logical Reasoning Algorithm, which is based on First Order Predicate Calculus and is designed to provide a framework to an LLM model to be able to apply the rules of logic to any situation that is based on the following rules and steps:

  Rule 1: If the reasoning involves drawing a conclusion from general premises to specific instances, then it is deductive reasoning.
  Rule 2: If the reasoning involves drawing a conclusion from specific instances to a general premise, then it is inductive reasoning.
  Rule 3: If the reasoning involves drawing a conclusion by explaining why something is observed to be the way it is, then it is abductive reasoning.

  Step 1: Determine the direction of the inference.
  Is the inference going from a general statement to a specific conclusion (deductive reasoning), from specific observations to a general conclusion (inductive reasoning), or from a specific observation to a likely explanation (abductive reasoning)?
  Step 2: Identify the key variables and their relationships.
  What are the key variables in the situation, and how are they related to each other?
  Step 3: Apply the rules of logic.
  Once you have identified the direction of the inference and the key variables and their relationships, you can apply the rules of logic to draw a conclusion.

  Args:
    situation: A string that represents the situation or statement.

  Returns:
    A string that represents the type of reasoning used in the situation or statement.
